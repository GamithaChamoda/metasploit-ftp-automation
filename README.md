# metasploit-ftp-automation
 A scripting tool that automates the exploitation of the vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor vulnerability on Metasploitable 2 using Bash and Metasploit. This project combines interactive Bash scripting with Nmap scanning and Metasploit RC scripting to streamline the entire exploitation process â€” from target selection to shell access.
